## Find Your Fridge Online
Project to allow people to find nearby community fridges. Currently working on NYC version! This project was started as part of a 12-week long mentorship as part of the Emergent Works program.

### What is a community fridge?
Community fridges offer free food and supplies to communities in need, no questions asked.

### Some things we'd like to do in the near future!
* Read from a database of community fridge locations
* Show map of fridges
* Use zipcode and area 
* Add metadata about site!
